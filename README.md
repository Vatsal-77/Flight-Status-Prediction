# Flight-Status-Prediction


Our project aims to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts flight delays or cancellations based on past data, enabling airlines to schedule and staff flights more efficiently and improve the travel experience for passengers. We obtained our dataset from Kaggle and performed data preprocessing and cleaning, followed by exploratory data analysis to visualize the data using various plots and graphs. Our EDA included creating heatmaps, histograms, jointplots, boxplots, scatterplots, and barplots to identify patterns and trends in the data. We also used machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and XGBoost to train and evaluate our model, achieving an accuracy score of 86%. Further on we implemented PCA to reduce the dimensionality and implemented the algorithms again which resulted in boosting the performance and getting an accuracy of 95%. Our project can help airlines make proactive adjustments to schedules, improve the passenger experience, and identify operational inefficiencies for cost savings and revenue growth.
